# Prolog
</br>Prolog or PROgramming in LOGics is a logical and declarative programming language. It is one major example of the fourth generation language that supports the declarative programming paradigm. This is particularly suitable for programs that involve symbolic or non-numeric computation.</br.
</br>Prolog language basically has three different elements −
</br>
*Facts* − The fact is predicate that is true, for example, if we say, “Tom is the son of Jack”, then this is a fact.
</br>
*Rules* − Rules are extinctions of facts that contain conditional clauses. To satisfy a rule these conditions should be met. For example, if we define a rule as −
</br>
grandfather(X, Y) :- father(X, Z), parent(Z, Y)
</br>This implies that for X to be the grandfather of Y, Z should be a parent of Y and X should be father of Z.
</br>
*Questions* − And to run a prolog program, we need some questions, and those questions can be answered by the given facts and rules.
</br></br>
Prolog is used in various domains. It plays a vital role in automation system. Following are some other important fields where Prolog is used −
</br>
*Intelligent Database Retrieval</br>
*Natural Language Understanding<br>
*Specification Language</br>
*Machine Learning</br>
*Robot Planning</br>
*Automation System</br>
*Problem Solving</br>
